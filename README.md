### Links

- Live Site URL: [Recipe Page on Netlify](https://recipepage-10.netlify.app/)

## My Process

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Codeium Cascade](https://codeium.com/cascade) via Windsurf - AI pair programming assistant
- Deployed with [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)

### Useful Resources

- [Codeium Cascade](https://codeium.com/cascade) (accessed through Windsurf) was invaluable for this project. I prompted it to be my HTML & CSS tutor since I hadn't practiced in a long time. It guided me through the steps without writing the code for me, acting like a senior developer providing guidance. The experience was enhanced by how easily I could deploy the GitHub repository to Netlify with Cascade's assistance.
